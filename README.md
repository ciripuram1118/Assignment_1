“Finding possible near misses for Fermat’s Last Theorem” 

Let x,y,z,n are natural numbers then by conserding this equation x^n + y^n = z^n we want prove that it has no non-trivial solution.This program will take two integers N and K from the user and will find the near misses of the form (x,y,z,n,k) using Fermat's theorem.
By considering the Fermat's Last Theorem, no three positive integers x,y,z satisfy the equation x^n + y^n <> z^n, n > 2.

Instructions for the JAR file:
To run the Fermat.jar file you need to open up the Command Prompt. Once the CMD
opens up then you need to go to the directory where the Fermat.jar file is saved.

For example if you save the Fermat.jar file to the desktop you should type in the CMD:

                          cd desktop (hit enter)

To run the Fermat.jar file you Should then type in the CMD:

                          java -jar Fermat.jar (hit enter)
